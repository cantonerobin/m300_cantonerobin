# Reflection
I enjoyed this assignment, I could combine already known things like Docker with new things like GitHub Actions and Vagrant.
I first had a more complex idea, which I had to simplify later. The latest state is visible under the "docker" folder. I wanted to install Nextcloud on top of the Debian Base image. This worked fine, but I could not solve a bug with apache. That's why I switched.

## What did I learn.
- Writing and dealing with DockerHub Actions.
- Using DockerHub as a registry

## What am I satisfied with?
I am satisfied that the whole process works. It's all automated and working.

## What will I do differently next time?
Better plan which features I want to implement.
