## Git
I have been using Git daily for approximately two years. At work, I am responsible for maintaining our internal GitLab server. In the SysOps department, we keep all our Bash scripts, Kubernetes config files, and other related items in separate repositories or branches.

## Vagrant
I have no experience with Vagrant, I have never worked with it before. A few months ago, I watched a YouTube video about it, but I haven't implemented anything myself.

## Packer
The same applies to Packer as it does to Vagrant. I have never done anything with it either.

## Ansible
I have worked extensively with Ansible, and I would still consider myself a beginner despite having gained some experience. At work, we use Ansible for server configuration, although not yet to the extent of rolling out the entire infrastructure in one go. However, we are making progress towards that goal. In my role, I frequently receive tasks to write playbooks.

## Docker
I have been working with Docker for about three years now. I am proficient in writing Dockerfiles and comfortable with working with repositories and docker-compose files.

## Kubernetes
In my work, I have gained some experience with Kubernetes. I have converted services from Docker to Kubernetes files, created ingresses, and made adjustments to deployments/stateful sets. Occasionally, I have also configured ConfigMaps. However, I haven't had much exposure to Helm charts yet.
